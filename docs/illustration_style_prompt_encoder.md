# Illustration-Style Prompt Encoder
![text](/docs/illustration_style_prompt_encoder.jpg)

Encodes the prompt using the text encoder (CLIP) model, generating embeddings that can guide the diffusion process. Similar to ComfyUI's native "CLIP Text Encode (Prompt)" node, but this one allows selecting a visual illustration style, ensuring the final generated image matches the chosen style.nado.

## Inputs

### clip

The text encoder (CLIP) model used to encode the text and generate embeddings.

### customization

Optional input, can remain disconnected. Allows users to configure styles according to their preferences by connecting a multi-line string that redefines one or more available styles. A style definition starts with ">>>" followed by the name of the style, then includes lines describing the template for that style. The template must include "{$@}" where the user's prompt will be inserted.
